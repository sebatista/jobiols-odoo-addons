While using the "Send a message" feature in Odoo records, every recipient of
the message automatically becomes follower of the record,if they are not
followers already. Becoming a follower means the recipients of the email,
especially customer, subscribes to the document automatically. Such a
subscription can be a challenge in terms of the privacy of the sales team and
the company when it comes to sale and invoice records. The internal
communications between the sales team will become available to the customer
as well.
