Configuration

Solo instalar el modulo

Usage
=====

When the expense is in the paid state, there is a new "back to posted" button
that works only if the payments corresponding to this expense were deleted.

If the expense is in the published state, a "Return to Approved" button appears
but only works if the journal items corresponding to this expense were manually
deleted.
